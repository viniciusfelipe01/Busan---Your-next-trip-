Hello, my name is Vinicius Souza, and this is my first project created independently since I started studying front-end web development.

This project focuses on building a simple webpage about a tourist destination, aiming to give readers reasons to visit the place through text and images.

I have been studying web development for two weeks through the Rocket Seat platform, and I am currently learning HTML and CSS.

In this project, I applied my knowledge of HTML markup, including:

  - Attributes;
  - Absolute and relative paths;
  - Images;
  - Links;
  - Structural, semantic, and generic tags;
  - Lists;
  - And a few other concepts.


I also had the opportunity to apply some CSS knowledge, including:

  - Box model;
  - Combinators;
  - Colours;
  - Fonts and text;
  - Selectors;
  - And a few other concepts.

As a final consideration, I would like to thank the entire RocketSeat team, and especially Professor Mayk Brito, for providing us with rich and easy-to-understand content.
